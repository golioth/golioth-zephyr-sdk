# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.0] - 2022-03-17
### Added
- LTE link monitor for nRF91

### Fixed
- flushing of reconnect requests (there is no more unwanted reconnection when using credentials from
  Zephyr settings)
- documentation for settings in Github Actions HIL (Hardware In the Loop) tests

### Breaking Changes
- calling `golioth_rpc_register()` no longer automatically observes. The RPC observation is now
  established only if the user calls `golioth_rpc_observe()`. Existing applications that use
  RPCs will need to call `golioth_rpc_observe()` in the `on_connect` callback. Additionally, it's
  recommended to move any calls to `golioth_rpc_register()` outside of the `on_connect` callback,
  to avoid registering the same RPC method multiple times. See the `rpc` sample for reference.
- calling `golioth_settings_register_callback()` no longer automatically observes. The settings
  observation is now established only if the user calls `golioth_settings_observe()`.
  Existing applications that use settings will need to call `golioth_settings_observe()` in the
  `on_connect` callback. See the `settings` sample for reference.

### Changed
- verified with Zephyr v3.3.0
- verified with NCS v2.3.0
- disabled `sockets_offload_poll_wrapper` by default (since there is proper fix in NCS 2.3.0)
- removed west projects filter in `west-zephyr.yml` to keep consistent behavior with `west-ncs.yml`
  (which is not filtered as well)

## [0.5.0] - 2022-12-13
### Added
- Python library and CLI tools for accessing Golioth REST API (`scripts/python/golioth/`)
- twister+pytest tests for `samples/rpc/`
- support for `GOLIOTHCTL_CONFIG` environment variable in pytest scripts
- `GOLIOTH_CIPHERSUITES` Kconfig option, which allows selection of preferred ciphersuites used
  during DTLS handshake (by default only one ciphersuite is selected to reduce DTLS handshake)
- configurable settings response length with `GOLIOTH_SETTINGS_MAX_RESPONSE_LEN`
- support for certificate-based authentication with `coap.golioth.io` in `sample/hello/`

### Fixed
- handling of multiple desired firmware changes in `samples/dfu/`, which previously caused corrupted
  firmware upgrade
- infinite loop in ciphersuite negotiation during DTLS handshake, solved by narrowing down used
  ciphersuites by introducing `GOLIOTH_CIPHERSUITES` Kconfig option
- handling of CoAP observation notifications (used by observations in LightDB State, DFU desired
  firmware, RPC and Settings services) with specific (too high) CoAP observe sequence numbers, which
  resulted in ignoring incoming CoAP observe notifications
- disconnecting (and reconnecting) from Golioth server on nRF9160 based devices, which sometimes
  resulted in deadlock on socket close operation
- handling of CoAP requests when disconnected from Golioth server (sending/scheduling requests is no
  longer possible when disconnected and already scheduled/pending requests are cancelled once client
  gets disconnected)

### Changed
- pytest tests for `samples/logging/` use introduced Python library instead of `goliothctl`
- hardware tests use `coap.golioth.dev` (backend development version)

## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-19
### Added
- offloaded sockets wrapper for using interruptible `poll()` with drivers implementing offloaded
  variant of this system call (workarounds limitations of nRF91 offloaded sockets)
- runtime tests with twister for most samples
- runtime `qemu_x86` tests in GitLab CI
- LightDB DELETE sample
- shared `coap_req` module used by LightDB, LightDB Stream, FW, RPC and Settings services
- CoAP packet retransmission as part of `coap_req` module implementation
- handling of DISCONNECT_RESULT WiFi management event, mainly to handle buggy WiFi drivers
  signalling such event for failed connection attempt
- exponential backoff mechanism for subsequent reconnect attempts in samples
- `qemu_x86` platform overlay for Settings sample
