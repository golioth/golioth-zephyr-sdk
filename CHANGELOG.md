## [0.4.0] - 2022-10-19
### Added
- offloaded sockets wrapper for using interruptible `poll()` with drivers implementing offloaded
  variant of this system call (workarounds limitations of nRF91 offloaded sockets)
- runtime tests with twister for most samples
- runtime `qemu_x86` tests in GitLab CI
- LightDB DELETE sample
- shared `coap_req` module used by LightDB, LightDB Stream, FW, RPC and Settings services
- CoAP packet retransmission as part of `coap_req` module implementation
- handling of DISCONNECT_RESULT WiFi management event, mainly to handle buggy WiFi drivers
  signalling such event for failed connection attempt
- exponential backoff mechanism for subsequent reconnect attempts in samples
- `qemu_x86` platform overlay for Settings sample

  - [369ec2a16788 ("samples: lightdb_stream: update to new API")](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-sdk/commit/369ec2a167885e8a03fd88743bb83add12e2229e)
- added dedicated APIs for LightDB Stream (`golioth_stream_*`), with no need to use
  `GOLIOTH_LIGHTDB_STREAM_PATH()` helper macro
- removed `GOLIOTH_LIGHTDB()` macro, which is no longer required with new LightDB APIs

### Changed
- samples wait for network interface UP and DHCP BOUND events, before returning from net_connect()
  helper function
- verified with Zephyr v3.2.0
- verified with NCS v2.1.0
- changed error reporting in Settings service to contain array with errors
- use eventfd mechanism in `system_client` for nRF91 family
- reworked internal RPC and Settings services to use shared `coap_req` (for code deduplication and
  packet retransmission)

### Removed
- CoAP message callback registration using `golioth_register_message_callback()` (no longer needed
  with CoAP agnostic APIs)
- `client->on_message()` callback (no longer needed with CoAP agnostic APIs)

## [0.3.1] - 2022-09-26

- use CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_{SSID,PSK} credentials in samples/settings/, similar to other
  samples
- fixed miscellaneous typos
- removed 'net' tag from all sample.yaml files, which was the reason of filtering out 'esp32'
  platform by twister

## [0.2.0] - 2022-07-01
### Added
- enabled `kernel reboot` command in `samples/settings/` sample

- verified with Zephyr v3.1.0 (and updated `west-zephyr.yml`)
- verified NCS v2.0.0 (and updated `west-ncs.yml`)

### Fixed
- fixed error code propagation from `golioth_send_coap()`
