Golioth DFU sample
##################

Overview
********

This DFU application demonstrates how to connect with Golioth and use Device
Firmware Upgrade (DFU) procedure.

The app is first built and flashed to the device which will then listen to
Golioth Cloud for a new firmware binary to become available. A second binary is
built with a new version number, registered as an artifact, and deployed as a
release. The device will detect this change and automatically download and
install.

Requirements
************

- Golioth credentials
- Network connectivity

nRF9160 DK with nRF Connect SDK
*******************************

Build Zephyr sample application for nRF9160 DK:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns samples/dfu
   $ west flash

Configure PSK-ID and PSK using the device shell based on your Golioth credentials and reboot:

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk-id <my-psk-id@my-project>
   uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk <my-psk>
   uart:~$ kernel reboot cold

Now rebuild the application with the new version number 1.2.3 to distinguish it
from the old firmware:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns samples/dfu -- -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION=\"1.2.3\"

Start DFU using goliothctl
==========================

Run following command on host PC to upload new firmware as artifact to Golioth:

.. code-block:: console

   $ goliothctl dfu artifact create build/zephyr/app_update.bin --version 1.2.3

Then create new release consisting of this single firmware and roll it out to
all devices in a project:

.. code-block:: console

   $ goliothctl dfu release create --release-tags 1.2.3 --components main@1.2.3 --rollout true


Jump down to the `Observe DFU process in target console output`_ section lower
on this page to see the expected behavior of the target device during DFU.

Using with Zephyr
*****************

Building and flashing MCUboot
=============================

Zephyr MCUboot target
---------------------

The below steps describe how to build and run the MCUboot bootloader. Detailed
instructions can be found in the `MCUboot`_ documentation page.

The Zephyr port of MCUboot is essentially a normal Zephyr application, which
means that we can build and flash it like normal using ``west``, like so:

.. code-block:: console

   west build -b <board> -d build_mcuboot bootloader/mcuboot/boot/zephyr
   west flash -d build_mcuboot

Substitute <board> for one of the boards supported by the sample.

Espressif MCUboot target
------------------------

Follow https://github.com/mcu-tools/mcuboot/blob/399720d1cabd26c4356445d351f263b31e942961/docs/readme-espressif.md
on how to build and flash MCUboot.

Building the sample application
===============================

Platform specific configuration
-------------------------------

nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This subsection documents using nRF52840 DK running Zephyr with offloaded ESP-AT
WiFi driver and ESP32-WROOM-32 module based board (such as ESP32 DevkitC rev.
4) running WiFi stack. See `AT Binary Lists`_ for links to ESP-AT binaries and
details on how to flash ESP-AT image on ESP chip. Flash ESP chip with following
command:

.. code-block:: console

   esptool.py write_flash --verify 0x0 PATH_TO_ESP_AT/factory/factory_WROOM-32.bin

Connect nRF52840 DK and ESP32-DevKitC V4 (or other ESP32-WROOM-32 based board)
using wires:

+-----------+--------------+
|nRF52840 DK|ESP32-WROOM-32|
|           |              |

+-----------+--------------+
|GND        |GND           |
+-----------+--------------+

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of this
sample application (i.e., ``samples/dfu``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 samples/dfu

Signing the sample image
========================

A key feature of MCUboot is that images must be signed before they can be
successfully uploaded and run on a target. To sign images, the MCUboot tool
``imgtool`` can be used.

To sign the sample image we built in a previous step:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west sign -t imgtool -- --key WEST_ROOT/bootloader/mcuboot/root-rsa-2048.pem

The above command creates image files called ``zephyr.signed.bin`` and
``zephyr.signed.hex`` in the build directory.

For more information on image signing and ``west sign``, see the `Signing
Binaries`_ documentation.

Flashing the sample image
=========================

Upload the ``zephyr.signed.bin`` (or ``zephyr.signed.hex``) file from the
previous step to first application image slot of your board (see `Flash map`_
for details on flash partitioning). Specify *signed* image file using
``--bin-file`` option, otherwise non-signed version will be used and image won't
be runnable:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west flash --bin-file build/zephyr/zephyr.signed.bin --hex-file build/zephyr/zephyr.signed.hex

.. note::

   Some west flash runners use ``bin`` file by default, while others use ``hex``
   file. This is why paths to both ``zephyr.signed.bin`` and
   ``zephyr.signed.hex`` are specified in executed command.

Run following command in Zephyr shell to confirm content of first application
slot (primary area):

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ mcuboot
   swap type: none
   confirmed: 1

   primary area (1):
     version: 0.0.0+0
     image size: 221104
     image hash: f48973eed40a9d30795df7121183e7a828e9b89aa5ee84f2db1318f7cf51be0b
     magic: good
     swap type: test
     copy done: set
     image ok: set

   failed to read secondary area (2) header: -5

Configure credentials
=====================

(``nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32`` and ``ESP32`` only) Configure WiFi SSID and PSK using the device
shell:

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ settings set wifi/ssid <my-ssid>
   uart:~$ settings set wifi/psk <my-psk>

Configure PSK-ID and PSK using the device shell based on your Golioth credentials and reboot:

.. code-block:: console

   uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk-id <my-psk-id@my-project>
   uart:~$ settings set golioth/psk <my-psk>
   uart:~$ kernel reboot cold

Prepare new firmware
====================

For testing purposes of DFU mechanism the same firmware will be used. To
distinguish between old firmware and new firmware, a firmware version will be
assigned during image signing process. Execute following command to generate new
signed application image:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west sign -t imgtool --no-hex -B new.bin -- --key WEST_ROOT/bootloader/mcuboot/root-rsa-2048.pem --version 1.2.3

Please note the differences between this step and `Signing the sample image`_.
``bin`` version of firmware image will be used for DFU, which is why
``--no-hex`` was specified to prevent generation of ``hex`` file. ``-B new.bin``
was specified to override default path of ``bin`` file and prevent overriding
original application image from `Signing the sample image`_. ``--version 1.2.3``
was specified to distinguish between old firmware (default version is ``0.0.0``
if not explicitly specified) and new firmware.

Start DFU using goliothctl
==========================

Run following command on host PC to upload new firmware as artifact to Golioth:

.. code-block:: console

   $ goliothctl dfu artifact create new.bin --version 1.2.3

Then create new release consisting of this single firmware and roll it out to
all devices in a project:

.. code-block:: console

   $ goliothctl dfu release create --release-tags 1.2.3 --components main@1.2.3 --rollout true

Observe DFU process in target console output
============================================

DFU process should be started in Zephyr and this is what should be visible on
serial console:

.. code-block:: console

At this point mcuboot swaps first application slot (containing old firmware)
with second application slot (containing new firmware). After few seconds (or a
minute depending on firmware size) new firmware will be booted from first
application slot and following messages should appear on serial console:

.. code-block:: console
