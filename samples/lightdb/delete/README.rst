Golioth LightDB Delete Sample
#############################

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to connect to Golioth and delete values from LigthDB.

Requirements
************

- Golioth credentials
- Network connectivity

Building and Running
********************

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your Golioth credentials:

- GOLIOTH_SYSTEM_CLIENT_PSK_ID  - PSK ID of registered device
- GOLIOTH_SYSTEM_CLIENT_PSK     - PSK of registered device

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. ``prj.conf``):

.. code-block:: cfg

   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SYSTEM_CLIENT_PSK_ID="my-psk-id"
   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SYSTEM_CLIENT_PSK="my-psk"

Platform specific configuration
===============================

QEMU
----

This application has been built and tested with QEMU x86 (qemu_x86).

On your Linux host computer, open a terminal window, locate the source code
of this sample application (i.e., ``samples/lightdb/delete``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b qemu_x86 samples/lightdb/delete
   $ west build -t run

See `Networking with QEMU`_ on how to setup networking on host and configure
NAT/masquerading to access Internet.

ESP32
-----

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP credentials:

- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID  - WiFi SSID
- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK   - WiFi PSK

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. ``prj.conf`` or
``board/esp32.conf``):

.. code-block:: cfg

   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK="my-psk"

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of this
sample application (i.e., ``samples/lightdb/delete``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b esp32 samples/lightdb/delete
   $ west flash

See `ESP32`_ for details on how to use ESP32 board.

nRF52840 DK + ESP32-WROOM-32
----------------------------

This subsection documents using nRF52840 DK running Zephyr with offloaded ESP-AT
WiFi driver and ESP32-WROOM-32 module based board (such as ESP32 DevkitC rev.
4) running WiFi stack. See `AT Binary Lists`_ for links to ESP-AT binaries and
details on how to flash ESP-AT image on ESP chip. Flash ESP chip with following
command:

.. code-block:: console

   esptool.py write_flash --verify 0x0 PATH_TO_ESP_AT/factory/factory_WROOM-32.bin

Connect nRF52840 DK and ESP32-DevKitC V4 (or other ESP32-WROOM-32 based board)
using wires:

Configure the following Kconfig options based on your WiFi AP credentials:

- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID - WiFi SSID
- GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK  - WiFi PSK

by adding these lines to configuration file (e.g. ``prj.conf`` or
``board/nrf52840dk_nrf52840.conf``):

.. code-block:: cfg

   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_SSID="my-wifi"
   CONFIG_GOLIOTH_SAMPLE_WIFI_PSK="my-psk"

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of this
sample application (i.e., ``samples/lightdb/delete``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b nrf52840dk_nrf52840 samples/lightdb/delete
   $ west flash

nRF9160 DK
----------

On your host computer open a terminal window, locate the source code of this
sample application (i.e., ``samples/ligthdb/delete``) and type:

.. code-block:: console

   $ west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns samples/lightdb/delete
   $ west flash

Set counter value
=====================

The device retrieves the value stored at ``/counter`` in LightDB every 5 seconds.
The value can be set with:

.. code-block:: console

   goliothctl lightdb set <device-name> /counter -b "{\"counter\":34}"
